PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: December 2024

Your Privacy Matters

Phone Mouse is designed with your privacy as a top priority. We
believe your data belongs to you, and you alone.

Data Collection

We collect ZERO data.

Phone Mouse does not:
- Collect any personal information
- Track your usage or behavior
- Store any data on external servers
- Require you to create an account
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Share data with third parties
- Display advertisements

How Phone Mouse Works

Phone Mouse operates entirely on your local network:
- Your iPhone and Mac connect directly to each other
- All communication happens between your devices only
- No data ever leaves your local network
- No internet connection is required (after download)

Permissions

Phone Mouse requests the following permissions:

Motion & Orientation - To use your phone's gyroscope for cursor
control in Gyro Mode

Local Network Access - To connect your iPhone to your Mac over
WiFi or Bluetooth

Camera (optional, future feature) - For potential optical tracking
 features

These permissions are used solely for the app's functionality. No
data from these sensors is ever stored or transmitted outside your
 devices.

Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing to:
- Request access to
- Delete
- Correct
- Export

Changes to Privacy Policy

If we ever change our privacy practices, we will update this page
and notify users through an app update.
